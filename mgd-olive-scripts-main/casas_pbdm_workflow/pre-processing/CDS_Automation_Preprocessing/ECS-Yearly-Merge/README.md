# Docker Workflow for Climate Data Integration and Processing System

This section of the Climate Data Integration and Processing System project details the workflow for building, running, and managing Docker containers. These containers are crucial for the yearly data processing task, encapsulating the application environment to ensure consistency across development and production settings. Below you'll find instructions for building your Docker image, running your container with environment configurations, tagging your Docker images, and maintaining your Docker environment. Additionally, guidance is provided for pushing images to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to facilitate integration with AWS services like ECS and Fargate for scalable, managed container execution.

## Building the Docker Image

Construct the Docker image from your Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t your_image_name .
```

*Note: Replace `your_image_name` with a suitable name for your Docker image.*

## Running the Container

Execute your Docker container using an environment configuration file:

```bash
docker run --env-file ./env.list your_image_name
```

*Ensure the `env.list` file includes all necessary environment variables for your application to function correctly.*

## Tagging a Docker Image

Assign a tag to your Docker image for versioning or organizational purposes:

```bash
docker tag original_image_name:latest original_image_name:your_tag
```

Example:

```bash
docker tag your_image_name:latest your_image_name:v1.0
```

## Docker Maintenance Commands

**Remove all unused images forcefully:**

```bash
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
```

**Remove all stopped containers:**

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

**Clean up unused Docker objects:**

```bash
docker system prune -a
```

**Prune unused volumes:**

```bash
docker volume prune
```

## Pushing to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

**Authenticate your Docker client to your AWS ECR registry:**

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region your_region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin your_account_id.dkr.ecr.your_region.amazonaws.com
```

*Substitute `your_region` and `your_account_id` with your specific AWS region and AWS account ID.*

**Build, tag, and push your Docker image to ECR:**

```bash
docker build -t your_ecr_repository_name .
docker tag your_ecr_repository_name:latest your_account_id.dkr.ecr.your_region.amazonaws.com/your_ecr_repository_name:latest
docker push your_account_id.dkr.ecr.your_region.amazonaws.com/your_ecr_repository_name:latest
```

*Ensure you replace `your_ecr_repository_name`, `your_region`, and `your_account_id` with the appropriate values pertinent to your project.*
